Hi, I’m DurgaRaoN

  I’m someone who is passionate about Computational Engineering, Machine Learning and Dynamic analysis on offshore structures.

  Currently, I'm working as a subsea engineer at a MNC company. I majored in Ocean Engineering from IIT Madras
  
  My main driver is Matlab, but I'm also proficient in Python and C++.
  
  Check out my project below:
  [Fluid Structure Interaction](https://github.com/raodnik/Term-paper-OE5450) - Numerical modelling of near-shore wave propagation in the presence of breakwater using Mild Slope Equation as governing Equation.
